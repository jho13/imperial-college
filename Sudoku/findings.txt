As far as computation goes, the difficulty corresponds to how many logical possibilites the computer needs to try before finding the solution. Therefore I have chosen the time taken for the program to solve the mysteries as an indication of the difficulty. 

'mystery1' is of "extremely hard" difficulty. 
The time taken is around 0.27s

'mystery2' is impossible to solve. 
The function 'solve_board' tries all logical possibilites and it could not find a solution.

'mystery3' is of "hard" difficulty.
 The time taken is around 0.07s
 
 As a reference, 'easy' took around 0.003s, 'medium' took around 0.0004s.
